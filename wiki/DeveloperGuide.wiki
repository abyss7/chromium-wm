= Introduction =

This page details the preferred way to work on Chromium WM.

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Prerequisites =

  * Committers will need an SVN account.

  * [http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/install-depot-tools depot_tools] is required on every platform, make sure it's correctly in your PATH.

= Initial checkout =

First, have gclient create its configuration file.

{{{
  gclient config https://chromium-wm.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src
}}}

Optional: Edit the {{{.gclient}}} file that was created, and add lines to exclude unneeded tests in order to syncing faster. This is described in [http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code#TOC-Reducing-the-size-of-your-checkout Reducing the size of your checkout].

Now do a sync to create the src/ folder and get the source code.

{{{
  # First time only you must use '--nohooks' to pull only source code, then install dependencies.
  gclient sync --nohooks
  src/build/install-build-deps.sh
  gclient sync
}}}

= Linking errors =

If you build with a component build, you will need to apply https://codereview.chromium.org/12377013/ locally in your tree after doing {{{gclient sync}}} until that CL lands in chromium.
